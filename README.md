# 💡 &nbsp;Why Minesweeper+?

<div align="center">

</div>

Minesweeper+ is a fresh take on the classic minesweeper game that was developed as a project in the Coding Academy bootcamp. Completed in just four days, this project showcases my programming skills and ability to think creatively. Using vanilla JavaScript and basic HTML and CSS, I created an updated version of the classic game with additional features and game modes that add new challenges and strategies. I also designed all of the game sprites myself. As my first project in the bootcamp, Minesweeper+ is a testament to my dedication and potential as a programmer.

I hope you have fun playing Minesweeper+ and experiencing all of the unique features and game modes that make it a thrilling update on the classic minesweeper game.

<br/>

# 🎮 &nbsp;Gameplay

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1671223261/MINESWEEPER/md-minesweeper-gameplay_hyauoo.gif">
</div>

In Minesweeper+, gameplay involves revealing tiles on a grid and trying to avoid the hidden mines while using logic to deduce the locations of the mines. Players click on tiles to reveal what is underneath, and if a mine is revealed, the game is lost. If a tile is revealed that does not contain a mine, a number will be displayed indicating how many mines are adjacent to that tile. Players can use this information to deduce the locations of the mines and avoid them as they continue revealing tiles on the grid. Players can also right-click on a tile to mark it as potentially containing a mine, which can be a helpful way for players to keep track of their deductions and mark tiles that they believe may contain mines.

The goal of the game is to successfully reveal all tiles on the grid without revealing any mines, allowing the player to win the game. Players can use features like hint, safe click, and mega hint to help them strategize and make informed decisions as they play.

<br/>

# 🔧 &nbsp;Features
Minesweeper+ takes the classic game to the next level with a wide range of innovative features that add new levels of strategy and challenge. From helpful hints and safe clicks to custom game modes and best record tracking, this section highlights all the unique features that make Minesweeper+ a must-play.

<br/>

## 🔍 &nbsp;Hint

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1671222493/MINESWEEPER/md-minesweeper-hint_hudctv.gif">
</div>

The hint feature allows players to reveal a 3x3 area of cells surrounding a selected cell for a brief moment. This can give players a better understanding of the layout of mines on the grid and help them strategize their moves.



<br/>

## 🧠 &nbsp;Mega Hint

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1671222491/MINESWEEPER/md-minesweeper-mega-hint_ksak0d.gif">
</div>

The mega hint feature allows players to reveal all of the cells between a selected starting cell and ending cell for a brief moment. This can give players a more comprehensive understanding of the layout of mines on the grid and help them strategize their moves more effectively.



<br/>

## 🛡️ &nbsp;Safe Click

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1671222489/MINESWEEPER/md-minesweeper-safe-click_cflzhj.gif">
</div>

Safe click is a feature in Minesweeper+ that highlights a cell that is known to be safe to click, allowing the player to make a move when they are stuck or uncertain of where to click next. This can be a helpful tool for players who are looking for additional guidance or who want to strategize their moves more effectively.

<br/>

## 🚫 &nbsp;Exterminator

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1671222489/MINESWEEPER/md-minesweeper-exterminator_iq4vul.gif">
</div>

The exterminator feature removes three mines from the grid, making it easier for players to win the game. This can be useful for players who are struggling to find mines or for those who want to try out different strategies without the risk of losing the game.

<br/>

## 💪🏼 &nbsp;First Click Is Safe
The first click in Minesweeper+ is always safe, meaning it will not contain a mine. This allows players to start the game without the added stress of potentially clicking on a mine on their first try.

<br/>

## 🔁 &nbsp;History

<div align="center">
    <img style="inline-block" width="200" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1671222491/MINESWEEPER/md-minesweeeper-undo-1_pttxzk.gif">
    <img style="inline-block" width="200" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1671222486/MINESWEEPER/md-minesweeper-undo-2_s2o8zj.gif">
</div>

In Minesweeper+, players have the option to use redo and undo buttons to help them strategize their moves and make changes to their game. The redo and undo buttons can be used from the start of the game and even after winning or losing, allowing players to make changes and try different approaches as they see fit. These buttons can be a helpful tool for players who want to experiment with different strategies or who want to make changes to their game after making a mistake.

<br/>

## 🌙 &nbsp;Dark Mode

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1671222489/MINESWEEPER/md-minesweeper-dark-mode_xualw5.gif">
</div>

The dark mode feature in Minesweeper+ allows players to switch to a darker color scheme for the game interface, which can be more comfortable to play in low light conditions. When activated, the game's colors will change to a darker palette.

<br/>

## 💕 &nbsp;Extra Lives

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1671223445/MINESWEEPER/md-minesweeper-extralives_ybawwt.gif">
</div>
The extra lives feature in Minesweeper+ allows players to have additional chances to continue playing the game after encountering a mine. In the beginner game mode, players start with 1 life, in medium mode players start with 2 lives, and in expert mode players start with 3 lives. If a player encounters a mine and loses a life, they can continue playing with one of their remaining lives. If a player runs out of lives, they will lose the game.

<br/>

## 🏆 &nbsp;Best Record

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1671222481/MINESWEEPER/md-minesweeper-best-score_lgmqyt.png">
</div>

After winning a game for the first time in a specific difficulty, the player's best time will be recorded and displayed under the board. This personal best time represents the fastest time that the player has completed the game in that difficulty, and is specific to the individual player (it does not show other players' scores).

<br/>

# 🎯 Game Modes
Minesweeper+ takes the classic game to the next level with a wide range of innovative features that add new levels of strategy and challenge. From helpful hints and safe clicks to custom game modes and best record tracking, this section highlights all the unique features that make Minesweeper+ a must-play.

<br/>

## 📊 &nbsp;Difficulty Levels

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1671222494/MINESWEEPER/md-minesweeper-diff-select_cqmtsr.gif">
</div>

The beginner mode is perfect for players who are new to the game or who want to ease into it gradually, while the medium and expert modes offer increasingly difficult challenges for more experienced players. No matter which game mode you choose, you'll be able to enjoy the classic minesweeper gameplay with a modern twist.

* Beginner: This game mode offers a 4x4 board with 1 hint, 1 mega hint, 1 safe click, 1 exterminator, and 1 life. It is suitable for players who are new to the game or who want to ease into it gradually.

* Medium: This game mode offers a 8x8 board with 2 hints, 2 mega hints, 2 safe clicks, 1 exterminator, and 2 lives. It offers a moderate level of difficulty and is suitable for players with some experience.

* Expert: This game mode offers a 12x12 board with 3 hints, 3 mega hints, 3 safe clicks, 1 exterminator, and 3 lives. It is the most challenging game mode and is suitable for experienced players who want a greater challenge.



<br/>

## 💥 &nbsp;7-Boom

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1671222494/MINESWEEPER/md-minesweeper-7-boom_il8rfo.gif">
</div>

In Minesweeper+, the 7-Boom game mode renders a board with mines placed in specific indexes, similar to the classic 7-Boom game. For example, the mines may be placed in indexes such as 0, 7, 14, 17, 21, and so on. The size of the board is based on the difficulty level that the player was on before choosing this mode. This game mode offers a unique twist on the classic minesweeper gameplay and can be a fun challenge for players to try.

<br/>

## 📏 &nbsp;Manual Mode

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1671222493/MINESWEEPER/md-minesweeper-manual_vqtxje.gif">
</div>

This game mode reveals the entire board and allows players to place the mines wherever they want. It also displays hint numbers as the player places the mines. When the player is finished setting the board, clicking the manual mode button again will start a new game with the custom layout that was created. The size of the board is based on the difficulty level that the player was on before choosing this mode. This mode is intended for creating custom boards for other players.

</br>

# 📐 &nbsp;Development
Minesweeper+ was developed as a project in the Coding Academy bootcamp, and was my first big project in the course. The task was to create a clone of the classic Minesweeper game in just four days, and I was able to complete the project within this time frame, including adding a lot of extra bonuses to the game and designing my own sprites.

The game was coded using simple HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with no additional libraries or frameworks.

I hope you enjoy playing Minesweeper+ and exploring all the different features and game modes that make it a unique and exciting update on the classic minesweeper game.

# 📄 &nbsp;About Me
I am Diego Monzon Contreras, a former student of Coding Academy, a coding bootcamp. One of my first big projects at the bootcamp was to create a clone of the minesweeper game, with the option to add additional features as bonuses. Within the four days allocated for the task, I managed to not only complete the entire game, but also add all the bonuses and create my own sprites for a visually appealing design. This was early on in the bootcamp, before we delved into CSS. I am very proud of the progress I made and the results of this project, which remains one of my favorites even though it was built using plain JavaScript without any frameworks or libraries.
